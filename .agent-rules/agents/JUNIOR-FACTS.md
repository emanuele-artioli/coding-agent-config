- No sudo and no apt. Extra tooling goes in its own user-space conda env.
- Headless host: save plots and media to disk. `plt.show()` and
  `cv2.imshow()` never work.
- Home is NFS, where `open()` is slow. Read many files with `xargs -P 24`.
  Keep regenerable caches on local disk: set
  `PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX=/var/tmp/emanuele-pycache`, scratch under `/var/tmp`.
- Put `import sqlite3` before `import torch`, or conda's libstdc++ bites
  at runtime.
- `gh` is on PATH and authenticated.
- A job over an hour checkpoints hourly, logs progress every ten minutes,
  and is launched detached.
- Plain words in chat, commits and comments.
- Hooks still deny hand-rolled wait loops, irreversible git, protected
  `rm`, and off-family model spawns, so those are not optional.
